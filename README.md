# Acoustic Content Challenge

## Challenge Description:

An article has been created in our Content product. You can retrieve the JSON representation using 
the API url:

* [Content URL]()

* [https://content-eu-4.content-cms.com/api/859f2008-a40a-4b92-afd0-24bb44d10124/delivery/v1/content/db4930e9-7504-4d9d-ae6c-33facca754d1](https://content-eu-4.content-cms.com/api/859f2008-a40a-4b92-afd0-24bb44d10124/delivery/v1/content/db4930e9-7504-4d9d-ae6c-33facca754d1).


The Article includes elements represented within the JSON:
* heading
* mainImage
* author
* date
* body

The coding activity:
* Using React, retrieve the content item (e.g. using the URL) and render the article elements within your single page application.
* You are free to design layout/styles and libraries in your SPA.
* Make it look simple, clean and easy to consume by a user.
* Code nicely. Think about error cases and tests, we expect it to be a production ready application.
* You can send us repo link or a zip file. Most of all, Have fun!
